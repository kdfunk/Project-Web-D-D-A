	<h1> About us </h1>
	<div class = "aboutus"></div>
		<p> We are a fashion comapny that supplies clothing 
		for all your luxury needs. Every week we recieve new
		clothing and luxury shoes and bags from the manufacturers
		specifically. This company was created as collaboration between
		a father and daughter who shared equal love for luxury items.
		One day they decided that in order for them to bond and to use 
		their shared interest, they should create a company that offeres
		the same services that they both love so much. It started
		off as a simple instagram page. It was slow starting off 
		as it wasn't well known or popular with instagram users.
		After a while it started to pick up speed and many people
		were texting the two CEO's in DMS to order or buy from them.
		This started to get hard for them to manage so they decided
		to create a website to seel their items. This is how AbitOfShoes
		was born. Today the two CEO's are starting to make a name for
		themselves within the fashion industry with many people offering 
		to purchase the clothing and shoes and also many people buying 
		from the website. Currently we have over 12 staff in our online
		presence, instagram, snapchat, facebook and the wbpage itself.
		I hope you guys enjoy your browse on the website. Don't hesitate 
		to contact us! Our contact information can be found on our contact
		page, and after youre done your browse, have a quick relax and treat
		yourself to the riddles we have on our game page.</p>
